UC Berkeley - Module 11 Practice Assignment 

## Summary 
In this assignment, we use learned techniques of modelling and cross-validation to help a used car dealership identify what customers value in a used car. We do this by setting the price of a car as the target, analyzing test and train datasets (extracted from the given used car data), and applying transformations to identify the most important features to customers. Then we present this back to the client in a readable format.
